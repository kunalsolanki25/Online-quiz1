INTRODUCTION

It provides a common platform to connect student and teacher online. The registered teacher can create Quiz and student can take quiz and can asses himself/herself.

DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

->SQLSERVER 

The full form of PHP is “Hypertext Preprocessor”. Its Original name was “Personal Home Page”.
Xammp is a server developed with php and installs an apache web server with php and MySQL and discovers php. Light and full versions are available for this program.
Xammp Server is software that contains PHP server, MySQL server and Apache server in a single package. It is a useful package for webmasters with which they will be able to test their project from their own system.
By the Middle of 1997, PHP was being used on approximately 50,000 sites worldwide.
PHP is server side scripting language, which can be embedded in HTML or used as a stand alone.
PHP doesn’t do anything about what a page looks and sounds like. In fact, most of what PHP does is invisible to the end user.
Someone looking at a PHP page will not necessarily be able to tell that it was not written purely in HTML, because usually the result of PHP is HTML.PHP is an official module of Apache HTTP Server.

->ABOUT THE SESSION

A  Session can be define as a series of related instruction between a single client and the web server, which take a place over an extended period of time. This could be a series of transactions that a user make while updating his stock or the set of requests that are made to check an e-mail account through a browser base e-mail service.
Particularly when you want to work with sensitive information, it makes a lot of sense to submit it once and have it stored on the server rather then client machine. 
Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses. This enables you to build more customized application and increase the appeal of your web sites.
A visitor accessing your web sites is assigned a unique id, the so-called session id. This is either stored in a cookie on the user side or is propagated in the URL.
The session support allows you to register arbitrary numbers of variables to be preserved across requests. When a visitor accesses your sites, PHP will check automatically or on your request whether a specific session id has been sent with the request. If this is the case, the prior saved environment is recreated.
All registered variable are serialize after the request finishes. Registered variable which are undefined are marked as being not defined.
On subsequent accesses, these are nit defined by the session module unless the user defines them later.
When working with sessions that a record of a session is not created until a variable has been registered using the session registered () function or by adding a new key to the $_SESSION super global array. This holds true regardless of it a session has been started using the session start () function.

->ABOUT THE HTML

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. 
HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of existing bodies of information. 
HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information initiative since 1990. This specification roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994.
HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The `text/html' Internet Media Type (RFC 1590) and MIME Content Type (RFC 1521) is defined by this specification.

->ABOUT THE JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is a scripting language most often used for client-side web development. It was the originating dialect of the ECMAScript standard. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions. 
JavaScript was influenced by many languages and was designed to have a similar look to Java, but be easier for non-programmers to work with. The language is best known for its use in websites (as client-side JavaScript), but is also used to enable scripting access to objects embedded in other applications.
Despite the name, JavaScript is essentially unrelated to the Java programming language, though both have the common C syntax, and JavaScript copies many Java names and naming conventions. 
The language was renamed from Live Script in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their browser, which was dominant at the time. The key design principles within JavaScript are inherited from the Self programming language.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS 

	SYSTEM ANALYSIS :-

Analysis is an important part of any project; is analysis is not done properly then whole project move in the wrong direction. It also provides a schedule for proper project work.
 Analysis task divided into 3 areas:
	Problem Recognition.
	Feasibility Study.
	Requirement Analysis.
1. Problem Recognition:
It is the phase in which the current need for the system is to be defined. Currently who want the best traveling schedule they have to go to find a best traveling schedule in a different places. This is very tedious for every particular person therefore we upload this site on internet.
This web-site should be developed with an aim to find a best traveling schedule to every people who wants and flexibility in performing each operation. 
2. Feasibility Study:
Feasibility study of the system is a very important stage during system design. Feasibility study is a test of a system proposal according to its workability impact on the organization, ability to meet user needs, and effective use of resources. Feasibility study decides whether the system is properly developed or not.
Following aspects are taken into account during feasibility study.
	Technical Feasibility:
It is not be affordable for the organization to employ new professionals then having a computer system thus the requirement makes it technical feasible.

	Economic Feasibility:
Implementation of this web-site will be a lifetime investment, which will ensure returns to the store of good services & market value through out the future.  So the system is found economically feasible.

	Operational Feasibility:
The web-site is easy to learn and it will require a very short time to learn the operation of the web-site for a person having knowledge about computer. So that system was operationally feasible.
As the web-site is made up in windows base environment so the graphical user interface made the web-site very user friendly and easy to operate.

4. Requirement Analysis:
“These are the basic facilities that the good computer consumable project must require and all other information that I require with enhance of usage.”
It is a website that is a bridge between access traveling information easily. We see this website & feel that of the facilities that a typical form type web-site provides. 

SYSTEM DESIGN

DIAGRAMS

About DFD (Data Flow Diagram):
The DFD (Data Flow diagram) is also known as Bubble chart. It is a simple graphical notation that can be used to represent a system in term of the input data to the system. Various processing carried out on this data, and the output data generated by the system. The main reason the DFD technique is so popular is on the account of the fact that it is very simple formulism-it is simple to understand and use. A DFD model uses a very limited number of primitive symbols.

1.	An External entity				     
2.	Process  
3.	 Data Store				             
4.	  Output  
5.	Data flow			
 	The Data Flow Diagramming technique follows the very simple set of intuitive concepts and rules. 

Data Flow Diagram (DFD) shows the flow of the data in to the system and processes and data stores. Data Flow Diagram has two types,   
1)	Logical Data Flow Diagram
2)	Physical Data Flow Diagram
